## Part 1: The Objective

The goal of Texas Hold’em is to win chips. You win chips in two ways:

- At Showdown: Have the best 5-card hand at the end of the round.
- By Folding: Bet enough that all other players fold (quit the hand) before the showdown.

The Golden Rule: You are dealt 2 private cards. There are 5 community cards dealt in the middle of the table. You must make the best possible 5-card combination using any combination of your 2 cards and the 5 community cards.

## Part 2: The Setup

- Players: 2 to 10 people.
- Deck: Standard 52-card deck (remove the Jokers).
- Chips: A poker chip set.
- Dealer Button: A disc usually marked "DEALER" (or any object to track who is dealing).

**Setting Up Chips (Recommended for a home game)**

Give every player the same amount of starting chips (the "Buy-in").
*Starting Stack*: Give everyone \$500 or \$1,000 in chips to start.

## Part 3: Hand Rankings (Highest to Lowest)

- **Royal Flush**: A, K, Q, J, 10 (all same suit).

- **Straight Flush**: Five cards in numerical order, all same suit (e.g., 5-6-7-8-9 of hearts).

- **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q-Q-Q-Q-2).

- **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., K-K-K-2-2).

- **Flush**: Five cards of the same suit, not in order.

- **Straight**: Five cards in numerical order, different suits (e.g., 4-5-6-7-8).

- **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank (e.g., 7-7-7-K-2).

- **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., 10-10-8-8-K).

- **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank (e.g., A-A-J-4-2).

- **High Card**: If you have none of the above, the highest card wins (Ace is high).

## Part 4: The Gameplay

A single game of poker ("a hand") is played in four betting rounds.

1. **The Blinds (Forced Bets)**:
Before cards are dealt, the two players to the left of the Dealer Button must put in money to start the pot.
*Small Blind (SB)*: Player to the immediate left of the Dealer. Puts in half the bet. 
*Big Blind (BB)*: Player to the left of the SB. Puts in the full bet.
*The Dealer Button* moves one spot clockwise after every hand.

2. **The Deal**:
The person with the Dealer Button shuffles. Starting with the Small Blind and moving clockwise, deal 2 cards face down to every player one by one. These are your "Hole Cards".

3. **Pre-Flop**:
*Betting Round 1* starts with the player to the left of the Big Blind (this position is called "Under the Gun").
Players look at their 2 cards. Moving clockwise, each player can:

   - Fold: Throw cards away and quit the hand.

   - Call: Match the amount of the Big Blind.

   - Raise: Increase the bet.

4. **The Flop**:
The dealer places 3 cards face up in the middle of the table. Everyone shares these cards.
*Betting Round 2* starts with the active player to the immediate left of the Dealer Button.
Options: Check (bet nothing but stay in), Bet, Call, Raise, or Fold.

5. **The Turn**:
The dealer places 1 card face up next to the flop (total of 4 community cards now).
*Betting Round 3*: Same rules as the previous round.

6. **The River**:
The dealer places the final 1 card face up (total of 5 community cards now).
*Betting Round 4*: The final chance to bet.

7. **The Showdown**:
If two or more players are still in the game after the River betting, they reveal their cards.
The player who made the last aggressive action (bet or raise) shows first.
Compare hands using the Best 5 Cards logic.
Winner takes all the chips in the pot.
If hands are identical, split the pot evenly.
